1,A network with a round-trip time (RTT) of 100 ms and a bandwidth-delay product of 500 packets experiences congestion. What is the primary goal of the TCP congestion control algorithm in this scenario?,MCQ,"['Reduce the bandwidth-delay product to half', 'Increase the transmission window size to its maximum', 'Reduce the transmission window size to half and halve the packet size', 'Double the packet size to improve throughput']",Increase the transmission window size to its maximum,Reduce the transmission window size to half and halve the packet size,False,"When a network experiences congestion, the primary goal of TCP congestion control is to reduce the load on the network by reducing the transmission window size. Halving the transmission window size reduces the amount of data being sent in the network, thereby reducing congestion. Additionally, halving the packet size reduces the average round-trip time, allowing the network to recover more quickly from congestion."
2,What is the primary goal of the congestion avoidance phase in TCP's congestion control mechanism?,MCQ,"['Maximizing network utilization', 'Minimizing network delay', 'Limiting congestion window to 1', 'Increasing packet size']",Minimizing network delay,Maximizing network utilization,False,"During the congestion avoidance phase, the primary goal is to maximize network utilization without causing further congestion. This is achieved by allowing the congestion window (cwnd) to increase, thereby allowing more packets to be sent into the network. However, the increase is not too aggressive, ensuring that the network does not get overwhelmed."
3,The congestion window (cwnd) size is determined by the slow start threshold (ssthresh). What happens when cwnd reaches the ssthresh threshold?,MCQ,"['The cwnd size is set to half of the ssthresh value and congestion avoidance phase begins.', 'The cwnd size jumps to its maximum value and congestion avoidance phase begins.', 'The cwnd size is set to ssthresh value and slow-start phase continues indefinitely.', 'The cwnd size is reduced to zero and a retransmission timeout occurs.']",The cwnd size jumps to its maximum value and congestion avoidance phase begins.,The cwnd size is set to half of the ssthresh value and congestion avoidance phase begins.,False,"When cwnd reaches the ssthresh threshold, the router detects congestion and the sender switches to congestion avoidance phase. In this phase, the cwnd is set to half of the ssthresh value to prevent further congestion."
